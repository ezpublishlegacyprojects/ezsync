Synchronize your dev environment with your production environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To synchronize your dev environment (local server) with your production environment (remote server) you need:

1. install rsync script on your local server and remote server (apt-get install rsync if you are in a debian-like dustribution)
2. configure settings/sync.ini.append.php file with your environment settings (you can have more environment to set)

|   Host is your remote host
|   Dir is the remote directory where put files
|   User is ssh user
|   Port is ssh port
|   Parameters are rsync extra parameters
|   FileRsyncEclude is the file rsync use to exclude files and dirs

3.run on the root of eZ Publish tree "php extension/ezdeploy/bin/sync.php --env=<ENV_NAME>", in this way rsync work in dry-run mode, so it really not synchronize but you can see the file that could be syncronized.
4.run on the root of eZ Publish tree "php extension/ezdeploy/bin/sync.php --env=<ENV_NAME> --go", in this way all file are really synchronized
